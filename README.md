## Background

Understanding lymph node (LN) metastatic patterns in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is crucial for accurate tumor staging and lymphadenectomy. This study employs data mining techniques to clarify these patterns in ESCC patients.
Previous studies on LN metastasis in ESCC have primarily focused on metastasis frequencies in specific regions. This study advances our understanding by pinpointing precise LN metastasis patterns using novel data mining techniques.

## Methods

The study analyzed 1,154 ESCC patients with recognizable LN metastasis who underwent surgery between September 1994 and December 2022. Network analysis and association rule mining were used to visualize and quantify LN metastasis patterns.

## Results

Network analysis revealed prevalent LN metastases, with association rule mining providing insights into their prevalence and interconnections. Zhang’s metric highlighted independent patterns of cervical LN metastasis.

## Conclusions

The use of data mining techniques has shed light on the complex patterns of LN metastasis in ESCC, suggesting the need for further analysis with larger datasets for validation.

## Keywords
